Small Object Detections Dataset (SOD-Dataset)
Dataset Title: Small Object Detections Dataset (SOD-Dataset)

Description: The SOD-Dataset is a specialized collection designed to advance small object detection capabilities. It contains high-resolution aerial photographs acquired via an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) consistently maintained altitude of 100 meters. The dataset is specifically curated to assist in identifying and analyzing small-scale objects that typically pose challenges in detection due to their size, mainly when observed from significant heights.

Data Collection Method: The dataset was compiled from a series of UAV flights, with the vehicle equipped with advanced imaging technology to capture detailed landscapes from a fixed altitude. The flight operations were executed under varying conditions, including a broad spectrum of lighting, weather, and environmental settings. This approach ensures diverse backdrops, from urban to rural and natural landscapes, enhancing the datasetâ€™s utility across different detection scenarios.

Intended Use: The SOD-Dataset is primarily intended for use within the computer vision community, targeting the development and refinement of algorithms focused on small object detection from aerial perspectives. It is applicable in fields such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, agricultural surveys, and emergency response planning.

Dataset Size: Contains 3000 images, each with a 4000 x 2250 pixels resolution. Total size 10GB, the variation in imagery accommodates different object sizes, densities, and contextual settings.

Access and Usage: The SOD-Dataset is distributed under specific terms and conditions for research and academic purposes to ensure proper use and citation. Interested parties are encouraged to review the usage guidelines and adhere to the prescribed ethical and legal standards.
